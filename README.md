# Filger

## Description:

 - Filger is a minimal buff/debuff tracker.
 - This Filger version was edited/rewriten by me to make it works with my oUF layout [oUF_Lua](https://github.com/PedroZC90/oUF_Lua).
 - Right now it just support Priest, Monk, Druid and Shaman.
 - If you need other classes suport, just add it respetive class spell list in "setting.lua".
