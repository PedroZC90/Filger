# Filger

Filger is a minimal buff/debuff tracker addon for [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/), which allows you to keep track of any buffs/debuffs of all units (player, target, focus, etc.) and player's items/spells cooldown.

 **obs.:** Only buffs/debuffs/cooldowns specified by you that will be tracked and displayed, and each spell need to be configure by it's respective spellID.
